On UBUNTU :
sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev
pip install pygraphviz
python manage.py graph_models -a -o ERD.png



on Windows : 

Here’s how to install Graphviz, pygraphviz, and generate an ERD on Windows.

Step 1: Install Graphviz on Windows
Download and Install Graphviz:

Go to the Graphviz download page.
Download the appropriate installer for Windows (either .exe or .msi).
Install it, and make sure to check the option to add Graphviz to the system PATH during installation, or add it manually later.
Verify Installation: After installing, open Command Prompt and verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy code
dot -V
This should return the version of Graphviz if it’s installed correctly.

Step 2: Install pygraphviz using pip
Set the Environment Variable for Graphviz: Before installing pygraphviz, ensure that Graphviz is in the system PATH. If it's not, follow these steps:

Open Start Menu, search for Environment Variables.
Click Edit the system environment variables.
In the dialog box, click Environment Variables.
Under System Variables, find the Path variable, select it, and click Edit.
Add the path where you installed Graphviz (e.g., C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin).
Install pygraphviz: Now, install pygraphviz using pip in your virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygraphviz
Step 3: Generate ERD using Django Extensions
Ensure Django Extensions is Installed: If you haven't installed django-extensions, do so by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install django-extensions
Update INSTALLED_APPS: Add 'django_extensions' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

python
Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'django_extensions',
]
Generate ERD: Now you can generate the ERD using the following command in your Command Prompt:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py graph_models -a -o ERD.png
This command will generate an image ERD.png in your project folder with the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of your models.

Troubleshooting Tips
If the command does not work, make sure that the Graphviz installation is correct and added to the PATH.
You can also try running the dot command directly to verify Graphviz:
bash
Copy code
dot -Tpng -O file.dot
If you get errors during pygraphviz installation, double-check that the graphviz binaries are available in your environment.
This should get pygraphviz and Graphviz working correctly on Windows!
